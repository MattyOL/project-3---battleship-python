# Sink the Battleship's Game

Battleship is a python terminal game which the user needs to sink the enemies battleship by submitting numbers between 1/99.  
# How to play? 

1. In this version , the player needs to enter numbers ranging from 1 to 99.

2. The player has a limited number of attempts (45), to sink the battleships if the user exceeds past the amount the game comes to an end.

3. The user will guess numbers across the grid to try indicate the location of the ship , the symbol will begin with a capital "S" when a ship has been 
struck, and will finish with a lowercase "s" when finished. If the location of were the user guessed is wrong the symbol will be marked with a capital "X" to show users attempt.

4. The game gives user feedback when they have submitted a false attempt Eg( letters) or Eg(duplication on numbers already submitted).

5. When the user has complety sunk all the battleships the Game will display feedback ( winner!! ).
